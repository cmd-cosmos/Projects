# Satellite Orbit Classification Project

- Coded in Python.
- Implements a decision tree classifier to classify satellites into LEO, GEO, MEO and Elliptical categories based on orbital parameters like Eccentricity, Semi-Major Axis, Period and Inclination.
- Can be run in Colab or the folder itself. Ensure that the UCS-Satellite-Database.xlxs is in the same directory as the program due to dependency.
